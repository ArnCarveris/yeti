## Intro

Yeti is a completely open-source game engine (with tools) that's not too dissimilar from [Autodesk Stingray](http://www.autodesk.com/products/stingray/overview) (n√©e Bitsquid). It's part of a larger vision of having high-quality, open-source software made available for making games. It's far from complete... but with some luck and a lot of work, it will be ready for production use in the near future.
