------------------------------
1.	Overview
------------------------------

Open Asset Import Library is a Open Source library designed to load various 3d
file formats and convert them into a shared, in-memory format. It supports more
than 30 file formats (basically, it is like DevIL for 3D models). It also
supports exporting, but the number of export formats is lower.

Its short name is 'assimp', which is an unintended joke (the abbreviation is
derived from 'Asset Importer').

Note: this README refers to the file structure used by release packages, which
differs in some points from the development trunk.


----------------
 1.1	Supported file formats
----------------

The library provides importers for a lot of file formats, including:
	- BLEND
	- DAE (Collada)
	- OBJ

 .. See http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_features_formats.html for
 a more exhaustive list.


----------------
1.2 Repository structure
----------------

Open Asset Import Library is implemented in C++ (but provides both a C and a
C++ish interface). The directory structure is:

	/build      Project files and build output (generated by premake)
	/code		Source code
	/contrib	Third-party libraries
	/include	Public header C and C++ header files.
	/test		Unit- and regression tests, test suite of models.
	/tools		Tools (command line `assimp`).


------------------------------
2. Build the library
------------------------------

Install premake4 (http://industriousone.com/premake/download), then:
premake4 gmake | xcode# | vs20####

3. Where to get help
------------------------------

Source code is right there!

4. License
------------------------------

The license of the Asset Import Library is based on the modified, 3-clause BSD-
License, which is a very liberal license. An _informal_ summary is: do whatever
you want, but include Assimp's license text with your product - and don't sue
us if our code doesn't work.

Note that, unlike LGPLed code, you may link statically to Assimp.
For the formal details, see the LICENSE file.
